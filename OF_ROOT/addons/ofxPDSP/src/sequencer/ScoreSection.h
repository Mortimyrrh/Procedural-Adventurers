    @brief Plays a single Sequence at time, sequences Sequences
    
    This class plays a single Sequence at time, sequences Sequences and has multiple outputs to connect to GateSequencer or ValueSequencer. ScoreProcessor owns a vector of ScoreSection. Remember that the ScoreSections inside a ScoreProcessor are processed from the first to the last so it could be possible for the data generated from the first ScoreSections in the vector to influence the others (in a thread-safe manner). In this doc, we refere to "Cell" as a combination of a pdsp::Sequence pointer and its associated pdsp::SeqChange behavior (for example pdsp::Behavior::Loop , pdsp::pdsp::Behavior::Random or pdsp::Behavior::Stop ),
