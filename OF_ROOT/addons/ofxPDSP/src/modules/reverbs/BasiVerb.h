/*!
@brief Dubby sounding reverb based on Moorer's reverb with added time modulations.

Default values are: time=3.33s, density=0.85, damping=0.25, hi_cut=8000hz, mod_speed=0.5hz, mod_amount=0.0ms. Most of the control values are update once per audio buffer, no crazy control modulations to this reverb.
